1. Introduction to JTML
JTML (JavaScript Template Markup Language) is a high-level language designed to seamlessly merge the simplicity of markup languages with the power of scripting. By combining these paradigms, JTML streamlines web development and supports advanced operations like database interactions, quantum computing simulations, and cryptography.

Key Features:

Intuitive Syntax: Clear and easy-to-learn syntax reduces the learning curve.
Integration with Modern Technologies: Built-in support for DB operations, quantum gates, and cryptographic primitives.
Scalable and Modular: Support for classes, modules, and packages ensures maintainable code at scale.
Use Cases:

Rapid web application prototyping.
Complex data-driven applications leveraging databases.
Experimentation with quantum computing and secure communications.
