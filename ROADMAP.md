# Roadmap
The JTML Compiler and Interpreter project is continuously evolving. Below is the roadmap outlining planned features and improvements based on the current file structure and official JTML documentation.

## Phase 1: Core Features Completion
### Parser Enhancements:

Complete grammar rules for all language constructs.
Implement comprehensive error handling with informative messages.
### Semantic Analyzer:

Implement type checking and scope management.
Handle advanced type features like generics and custom types.
### Intermediate Representation (IR):

Develop a robust IR for optimization and code generation.
## Code Generator:

Finalize code generation for target languages (e.g., JavaScript, Python).
Optimize generated code for performance and readability.
## Phase 2: Advanced Language Features
### Quantum Computing Integration:

Enhance quantum operations and simulate complex quantum algorithms.
Integrate with existing quantum frameworks like Qiskit for extended capabilities.
### Cryptography Modules:

Expand cryptographic functions to support a wider range of algorithms.
Implement secure key management and storage practices.
### Concurrency and Multithreading:

Optimize concurrency features for better performance.
Implement advanced synchronization mechanisms.
## Phase 3: Tooling and Ecosystem
### IDE Support:

Develop plugins or extensions for popular IDEs to support JTML syntax highlighting, autocompletion, and debugging.
### Package Manager:

Create a package manager for JTML to facilitate module distribution and dependency management.
### Comprehensive Documentation:

Expand official documentation with tutorials, examples, and API references.
Implement a searchable documentation site using MkDocs.
## Phase 4: Community and Open Source
### Open Source Release:

Prepare the project for open-source release, including licensing and contribution guidelines.
### Community Building:

Foster a community around JTML through forums, chat groups, and regular updates.
Encourage contributions by maintaining a clear contribution roadmap and providing ample documentation.
## Phase 5: Optimization and Maintenance
### Performance Optimization:

Profile and optimize the compiler and interpreter for faster execution times.
Implement caching mechanisms where applicable.
### Security Audits:

Conduct thorough security audits to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.
Ensure compliance with best security practices, especially in cryptographic operations.
### Regular Updates:

Maintain the project with regular updates, bug fixes, and feature enhancements.
Monitor and incorporate feedback from the user community.
